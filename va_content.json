Explore Your Benefits Our Missions In addition to our primary mission, VA carries out four specific missions to make good on our commitment to Veterans and other beneficiaries. Veterans Health Care VA’s Veterans Health Administration is the largest integrated health care network in the United States, with 1,255 health care facilities serving 9 million enrolled Veterans each year. Veterans Benefits Veterans can earn a range of benefits that help them transition back to civilian life in the country they fought to defend. Through the Veterans Benefits Administration , VA helps service members transition out of military service, and assists with education, home loans, life insurance and much more. National Cemeteries The job of the National Cemetery Administration is to make sure those who served this nation are never forgotten. NCA provides dignified burial services for Veterans and eligible family members by maintaining more than 150 cemeteries as national shrines and provides digital memorialization at the Veterans Legacy Memorial to commemorate their legacy, service and sacrifice to our nation. The Fourth Mission VA’s “Fourth Mission” is to improve the Nation’s preparedness for response to war, terrorism, national emergencies, and natural disasters by developing plans and taking actions to ensure continued service to Veterans, as well as to support national, state, and local emergency management, public health, safety and homeland security efforts. Our Core Values – ICARE Integrity: Act with high moral principle. Adhere to the highest professional standards. Maintain the trust and confidence of all with whom I engage. Commitment: Work diligently to serve Veterans and other beneficiaries. Be driven by an earnest belief in VA’s mission. Fulfill my individual responsibilities and organizational responsibilities. Advocacy: Be truly Veteran-centric by identifying, fully considering, and appropriately advancing the interests of Veterans and other beneficiaries.

    "content": "VA accredited representative FAQs Get answers to common questions about VA-accredited representatives. VA’s Office of General Counsel accredits 3 types of representatives: Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representatives, attorneys, and claims agents. These representatives can provide you with responsible, qualified representation on your VA benefit claims. Choosing a type of accredited representative to work with All VA-accredited representatives are authorized to provide help with VA benefit claims to Veterans and service members, as well as their dependents and survivors. Keep reading to learn about the differences between the 3 types of accredited representatives. Note: If someone isn’t recognized by VA, they can’t legally help you with a VA benefit claim. Learn about actions that require accreditation Learn about unaccredited individuals and organizations on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau website What services do accredited VSO representatives often provide? An accredited VSO representative can help you gather evidence, file a claim, or request a decision review. And they can communicate with VA on your behalf. The services that an accredited VSO representative provides on your VA benefit claim are always free. Veterans use accredited VSO representatives more often than other types of representatives on initial benefit claims. Note: Generally, when you work with an accredited VSO representative, the Veterans Service Organization as a whole is representing you. Check our list of VA-recognized Veterans Service Organizations What services do accredited attorneys or claims agents often provide? Some VA-accredited attorneys and claims agents provide services for free on initial claims. But most accredited attorneys and claims agents offer their services after we’ve made a decision on your initial claim. At this stage in the claims process, we permit them to charge fees for their services. Accredited attorneys and claims agents can help gather additional evidence and write legal arguments for your Supplemental Claim, Higher-Level Review, or appeal to the Board of Veterans’ Appeals. Other questions you may have about accredited representatives VA’s Office of General Counsel administers the VA accreditation process. To get accredited, a person must have good character and a good reputation. They must be capable of providing responsible, qualified representation. The requirements are specific to the type of accreditation. Here are some of the requirements to becoming accredited: An accredited VSO representative must be recommended to the Office of General Counsel by a VA-recognized VSO An accredited attorney must be a member in good standing of at least one state bar An accredited claims agent must pass a written test about VA laws and procedures You can discharge your accredited representative at any time and for any reason. Or, you can appoint a new accredited representative to replace your current one. If you do, you should tell your former accredited representative of your decision right away. Find and appoint an accredited representative Choose 1 of these 3 ways to cancel your representation: Call us at 800-827-1000 ( TTY: 711 ) . Mail a letter to this address: Claims Intake Center PO BOX 4444 Janesville, WI 53547 Fax a letter to if you live in the U.S. (Or, if you live outside the U.S., fax a letter to .) An accredited attorney or claims agent can charge you fees for their services only after all of these are true: We made a decision on your initial claim, and We received a fee agreement signed by both you and the accredited attorney or claims agent, and We received your VA Form 21-22a appointing the accredited attorney or claims agent as your representative Before choosing someone to help you with your claim, make sure they’re accredited with VA. You’ll also want to discuss the fee amount, how it will be paid, and what happens if you discharge the accredited attorney or claims agent. And you’ll want to discuss what happens if they withdraw from representation before an award of benefits. If you entered into a fee agreement with an accredited attorney or claims agent and you discharge them or they withdraw from the case before benefits are awarded, we urge you to review your agreement and discuss their contributions to the case at the time of their discharge or withdrawal. In some cases, typically when only a small amount of work has been done on the case, the accredited attorney or claims agent will waive their eligibility for fees at that time. If they don’t, and you receive a favorable decision on your claim, the accredited attorney or claims agent may be determined eligible to receive the total amount stated in your fee agreement. If you disagree that they should receive that amount, you may request that the Office of General Counsel review the fee to make sure it is fair, but you must act quickly. Learn how to challenge a fee (PDF) Yes. If you believe an accredited representative demonstrated a lack of skill or engaged in misconduct, you can file a complaint with VA’s Office of General Counsel. Learn how to file a complaint (PDF) The Office of General Counsel has the authority to investigate potential violations of VA’s professional standards of conduct for accredited representatives.

Both of these must be true: You have a current illness or injury (known as a condition) that affects your mind or body, and You served on active duty, active duty for training, or inactive duty training And at least one of these must be true: You got sick or injured while serving in the military—and can link this condition to your illness or injury (called an in-service disability claim), or You had an illness or injury before you joined the military—and serving made it worse (called a pre-service disability claim), or You have a disability related to your active-duty service that didn’t appear until after you ended your service (called a post-service disability claim) Presumptive conditions For some conditions, we automatically assume (or “presume”) that your service caused your condition. We call these presumptive conditions. If you have a presumptive condition, you don’t need to prove that your service caused the condition. You only need to meet the service requirements for the presumption. Find out more about these categories of presumptive conditions: A chronic (long-lasting) illness that appears within 1 year after discharge An illness caused by contact with contaminants (toxic chemicals) or other hazardous materials An illness caused by your time spent as a prisoner of war (POW) What should I do if I received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable discharge?

Usually we need medical records or medical opinions from health care providers to support this link. We may also accept lay evidence, like a buddy statement (VA Form 21-10210). In certain situations, we may conclude that there’s a link between your military service and your disability even if there’s no evidence.

    "title": "Disability Compensation Effective Dates | Veterans Affairs",
    "content": "In this section Disability compensation effective dates When we decide we’ll pay a disability benefit based on a claim, we assign an effective date to that claim. The effective date is the day you can start getting your disability benefits. This varies with the type of benefit you’re applying for and the nature of your claim. How does VA decide effective dates? It depends on the situation. Learn how we decide effective dates in different cases. Direct service connection The effective date for a disability that was caused—or made worse—by military service is whichever of these comes later: The date we get your claim, or The date you first got your illness or injury (also known as the date your entitlement arose) If we get your claim within one year of the day you left active service, the effective date can be as early as the day following separation. Example 1 Shaun is a Veteran who ended his active service on September 30, 2013, with a hearing disability. He filed a claim for his hearing problem more than a year later. We got Shaun’s claim on November 15, 2014. On March 10, 2015, we awarded Shaun a 30% disability rating with an effective date of November 15, 2014—the date we got the claim. Example 2 Ric is a Veteran who ended his active service on September 30, 2013, with a hearing disability. He filed a claim for his hearing problem less than a year later. We got Ric’s claim on July 5, 2014. Because we got it within 1 year of his separation from active service, we awarded Ric a 30% disability rating with an effective date of October 1, 2013—the day after Ric’s separation from the military. Presumptive service connection In most cases, if we believe your disability is related to your military service (known as a presumptive service connection)—and we get your claim within one year of your separation from active service—then the effective date is the date you first got your illness or injury. If we get your claim more than 1 year after your separation from active service, the effective date is the date we got your claim or when you first got your illness or injury—whichever is later. Example 1 Beth is a Veteran who separated from active service on September 30, 2013. Medical tests from April 15, 2014, showed she had hypertension (high blood pressure). Less than 3 months later, Beth filed a claim that we got on July 1, 2014. We concluded that her high blood pressure was related to her service. Because we got the claim less than 1 year after Beth separated from active service, the effective date was April 15, 2014—the date when she first got her illness. Example 2 Susan is a Veteran who ended her active service on September 30, 2013. Medical tests from April 15, 2014, showed she had hypertension (high blood pressure). More than a year later, Susan filed a claim that we got on October 2, 2014. We concluded that her high blood pressure was related to her service. Because we got the claim more than 1 year after Susan separated from active service, the effective date was October 2, 2014—the date we got the claim. Reopened claims The effective date for a reopened claim is the date we get the claim to reopen, or the date you first got your illness or injury, whichever is later. Liberalizing law change If there’s a change in law or VA regulation that allows us to pay disability compensation (monthly payments), the effective date may be assigned in any of these ways: If we get your claim within one year of a law or regulation changing, the effective date may be the date the law or regulation changed. If we review your claim—or you request a review—more than one year after the law or regulation changed, the effective date may be up to one year before the date we got your request or the date we decided to pay benefits on your claim. Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) For claims based on a Veteran’s death in service, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died, or was presumed to have died. This is true only if we get the claim within one year of the date of the report of the Veteran’s actual or presumed death. Otherwise, the effective date is the date we get the claim. If the Veteran’s death happened after service and we get the claim within one year of their death, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died. If the death happened after service and we get the claim more than one year after the Veteran’s death, the effective date is the date we get the claim. Error in a previous decision If we find a clear and unmistakable error in a prior decision, the effective date of the new decision will be the date from which benefits would’ve been paid if there hadn’t been an error in the prior decision. Difference of opinion A decision that’s based on a difference of opinion will have an effective date of the original decision, had it been favorable. Increases in the disability We date back increases in the disability rating to the earliest date when you can show there was an increase in disability. This is only if we get the new claim request within one year from that date. Otherwise, the effective date is the date we get the claim. Disability or death due to a hospital stay If we get a claim within one year after the date the Veteran suffered an injury, or their existing injury got worse, the effective date is the date the injury happened or when it began to get worse. If we get a claim within one year of the date of a Veteran’s death, the effective date is the first day of the month in which the Veteran died. If we get a claim more than one year after a Veteran suffered an injury, their injury got worse, or they died, the effective date is the date we get the claim.

Find out how to submit a fully developed claim. And learn what evidence you’ll need to submit along with your claim. What do I need to do to submit a fully developed claim? Here’s what you’ll need to do for us to consider your claim fully developed: Submit your completed Application for Disability Compensation and Related Compensation Benefits (VA Form 21-526EZ) , and Submit all the evidence (supporting documents) you have along with your claim, and Certify that there’s no more evidence we might need to decide your claim, and Go to any VA medical exams that we schedule, if we decide these exams are needed to make a decision on your claim What evidence will I need to submit along with my disability claim? You’ll need to submit this evidence: All private medical records related to the claimed condition, like reports from your own doctor or X-rays or other test results from a non-VA hospital or other treatment center, and Any records of medical treatment you’ve received for the claimed condition while serving in the military, and Any military personnel records you have that relate to the claimed condition, and Information about any related health records that you don’t have but that we can request on your behalf from a federal facility like a VA medical center or clinic If you think your service records don’t include a description of your disability , you can also submit letters from family members, friends, clergy members, law enforcement personnel, or those you served with that can tell us more about your claimed condition and how and when it happened. Note: In 1973, a fire at the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) in St. Louis destroyed records held for Veterans who were discharged from the Army and Air Force during certain periods of time. If your records were destroyed in this fire, you can get help reconstructing them. Find out how to reconstruct your records Are there any risks to using the Fully Developed Claims program? No. Filing a fully developed claim won’t affect the attention we give to your claim or the benefits you’re entitled to receive. If we determine that we need other non-federal records to make a decision on your claim, we’ll simply remove the claim from the Fully Developed Claims program and process it as a standard claim. What should the evidence show to support my disability claim? This depends on the type of claim you’re filing. Check what evidence is needed for different types of claims Can VA help me gather evidence? Yes. We can help you gather evidence for the Fully Developed Claims program in these ways: We’ll request your military service records (with your permission), and We’ll request relevant Social Security benefits information and medical records that you identify and authorize us to get from a federal facility, like a VA medical center, and We’ll schedule a health exam for you or get a medical opinion from a health care provider if we decide we need it for your claim Note: Even though we’ll gather federal records (like your DD214 or VA medical records) on your behalf, we encourage you to submit these if you have them to save time in the process. When should I turn in my evidence? You’ll need to turn in your evidence at the same time as you file your claim. If you’re filing online, upload your medical evidence or supporting documents at the end of the disability compensation form. If you turn in more information or evidence after you submit your fully developed claim, we’ll remove your claim from the FDC program and process it as a standard claim. How do I file a fully developed claim? You can file a fully developed claim online, by mail, by fax, in person, or with the help of a trained professional. Find out how to file a fully developed claim for disability compensation Should I work with a Veterans Service Organization (VSO) representative to file my claim? You don’t have to, but we encourage you to work with an accredited VSO representative. These trained professionals can help you file your claim and gather the needed medical records and evidence. Get help filing a claim Should I submit an intent to file? If you’re not ready to file your claim yet, you may want to submit an intent to file. This sets a potential start date (or effective date) for your benefits, so you may be able to get retroactive payments.

You can also sign in to VA.gov to view dependents currently added to your benefits. Am I eligible for additional VA disability compensation for one or more of my dependents? You may be eligible for additional disability compensation for a qualified spouse, child, and/or parent if you meet both of these requirements. Both of these must be true: You’re eligible for VA disability compensation, and You have a combined disability rating of at least 30% Adding a dependent may make you eligible to receive a higher compensation payment (also called a benefit rate). Who does VA consider a dependent?

If you haven’t yet filed a claim for disability compensation You can file a claim for additional compensation for a dependent at the same time as you file your original claim for disability compensation.

If we award you additional disability compensation, we’ll give you back pay from the original date we received your paper form. We may pay you back to the date of your marriage or the birth or adoption of your child if you meet all of these requirements. All of these must be true: You had already received a combined disability rating of at least 30% at the time of the marriage, birth, or adoption, and You file your claim for additional disability compensation for the dependent within a year of the marriage, birth, or adoption, and You respond within a year to our request for any more information or evidence needed to confirm your claim If it’s been more than one year since you got married or had or adopted a child, we may not pay you back to the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption. Instead, we may pay you back only to the date we received your claim for additional disability for the dependent or, in some cases, up to a year before this date. We’ll begin paying you within 2 weeks after we approve your claim. Questions about adding or removing certain kinds of dependents If you and your spouse are both Veterans with a combined disability rating of at least 30%, you can both receive additional disability compensation for each other and for your children. You should know: It’ll take us longer to process your claim if your spouse is also a Veteran. But if you file your claim online, and we decide you’re eligible for additional disability compensation for your dependent(s), we’ll pay you back to the date you started the online claim process. You can use our online tool to remove a divorced spouse or a dependent from your disability compensation. We’ll need more time to process a request that involves a child than a request that involves a spouse, but the online process is still much faster than submitting a paper request. If you get divorced, you’ll want to notify us right away. You don’t need to send or upload supporting documents in this case. This will help to make sure we don’t continue paying you additional disability compensation for your former spouse and, if applicable, stepchildren after the divorce. If we continue paying you benefits that you’re not eligible for, we may withhold money from future payments until you’ve paid us back. If you have a child who will remain in school past the age of 18, you’ll need to add their information again in our online tool. This is because we automatically remove children from disability compensation when they turn 18. No. We’ll track your child’s age based on the date of birth you give us when you submit your claim. When your child turns 18, we’ll stop paying additional disability compensation for them unless you let us know they’re enrolled in school full time.

If you’ve served on active duty after September 10, 2001, you may qualify for the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Find out if you can get this education benefit. You may qualify for additional entitlement under the Rudisill decision If you have 2 or more qualifying periods of active duty, you may now qualify for up to 48 months of entitlement. You must be eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD). Note: Even if you gave up your right to use MGIB-AD benefits in the past (we call this “relinquishing” your benefits), you may now qualify to use some of that entitlement. Find out if you can use more than 1 education benefit Am I eligible for Post-9/11 GI Bill (Chapter 33) benefits? You may be eligible for education benefits if you meet at least one of these requirements. At least one of these must be true: You served at least 90 days on active duty (either all at once or with breaks in service) on or after September 11, 2001, or You received a Purple Heart on or after September 11, 2001, and were honorably discharged after any amount of service, or You served for at least 30 continuous days (all at once, without a break in service) on or after September 11, 2001, and were honorably discharged with a service-connected disability, or You’re a dependent child using benefits transferred by a qualifying Veteran or service member Note: If you’re a member of the Reserves who lost education benefits when the Reserve Educational Assistance Program (REAP) ended in November 2015, you may qualify to receive restored benefits under the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Does VA consider some periods of service to be “non-qualifying”? Yes. Some periods of service are non-qualifying. If you have non-qualifying service, it means that period of service doesn’t count toward your Post-9/11 GI Bill eligibility requirements. We consider these periods of service to be non-qualifying: Your branch of service assigned you to a civilian school for classes that were the same in substance as classes offered to civilians, or You served as a cadet or midshipman at a service academy, or When you enlisted in the Army National Guard, Air National Guard, or Reserve, you received training according to section 12103(d) (initial skills and training) of title 10, or The Reserve called you to active duty under a section other than 688, 12301(a), 12301(d), 12301(g), 12301(h), 12302, 12304, 12304a, or 12304b of title 10 or section 3713 of title 14, or The President of the United States called you to full-time service in response to a national emergency that federal funds supported that wasn’t under section 502(f) of title 32, or You served full-time in the National Guard for a purpose other than to organize, administer, recruit, instruct, or train under section 502(f) of title 32 We also consider any period of service that counts toward one of these Department of Defense (DoD) programs to be non-qualifying: Loan Repayment Program (LRP) Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) Scholarship Service Academy Graduation What if I’m eligible for more than 1 VA education benefit? If you’re eligible, you may be able to use more than 1 education benefit depending on how many qualifying periods of active duty you’ve completed. If you’ve completed 1 qualifying period of active duty For a period of active duty that started on or after August 1, 2011 You can use only 1 education benefit. You’ll have to choose which education benefit you’d like to use. Once you make that choice, you give up the right to use the other benefit. You can use up to a maximum of 36 months of education benefits. If you choose to use the Post-9/11 GI Bill, you can’t switch at a later date to use one of these other education benefits instead: Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD or Chapter 30) Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR or Chapter 1606) Note: It’s also true that if you choose to use MGIB-AD or MGIB-SR, you can’t switch at a later date to use Post-9/11 Bill benefits. If you decide to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits and you use up all your entitlement for that benefit, we’ll refund you part or all of the payments you made into MGIB-AD. The maximum amount you can get for a refund is $1,200. Learn more about Montgomery GI Bill refunds For a period of active duty that started before August 1, 2011 You can use MGIB-AD or MGIB-SR benefits and then switch to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. This is how your decision to switch affects your benefits: You give up the right to use your MGIB-AD or MGIB-SR benefits, and If you switch from using MGIB-AD to using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you can use only your remaining entitlement from MGIB-AD when you start using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Example: If you have 6 months of MGIB-AD entitlement left when you switch, you’ll have 6 months of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to use. You can’t switch from using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits to using MGIB-AD or MGIB-SR. This is because when you choose to use Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you give up your right to use MGIB-AD and MGIB-SR. If you’ve completed 2 or more qualifying periods of active duty You may qualify for a maximum of 48 months of benefits if you’re eligible for the Post-9/11 GI Bill and MGIB-AD benefits. Recent changes under the Rudisill decision If you gave up MGIB-AD benefits when you switched to Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you may now qualify for up to 12 months of additional MGIB-AD benefits. If you’re currently using MGIB-AD benefits and you switch to Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, you’re no longer restricted to your remaining MGIB-AD entitlement. Note: We consider any reenlistment a separate period of active duty. But an extension isn’t a separate period of active duty. Learn more about how the Rudisill decision affects you How to get additional entitlement if you’re eligible If you last received an education claim decision on or after August 15, 2018, you don’t need to take any action. We will automatically review your entitlement and notify you if there are changes. If you last received an education claim decision before August 15, 2018, you’ll need to submit a Request for Change of Program or Place of Training (VA Form 22-1995). Request additional entitlement using VA Form 22-1995 When we receive your request, we will review your entitlement and notify you if there are changes. Note: The online version of VA Form 22-1995 will prompt you with a question about whether your request is related to the Rudisill decision. Be sure to tell us if you’re requesting a Rudisill review.

Learn how we determine your payments for undergraduate and graduate degree courses at institutions of higher learning—like a community college, 4-year university, or graduate school. How does VA determine my monthly payment rate? If you’re using Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits (Chapter 33) We determine your monthly payment rate based on these factors: How many credits you’re taking each term (credit hours), and How long you served on active duty (your eligibility tier), and Your active duty status, and The location of your classes, and If your classes are in-person or online (distance learning), and The dates of your term Check Post-9/11 GI Bill rates If you’re using other VA education benefits (Chapters 30, 1606, or 35) For the Montgomery GI Bill Active Duty (MGIB-AD), Montgomery GI Bill Selected Reserve (MGIB-SR), and Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance (DEA), we determine your monthly rate based on these factors: How many credits you’re taking each term (credit hours), and The dates of your term, and Your active duty status You’ll get a set rate for what we consider to be full time, three-quarter time, half time, and less than half time: 12 or more credit hours is full time 9 to 11 credit hours is three-quarter time 6 to 8 credit hours is half time If you’re taking fewer than 6 credit hours, we’ll reimburse you at a set rate that’s no more than the cost of your tuition and fees.

We determine payments for graduate-level and undergraduate programs in the same way. The difference is that for graduate-level programs, we pay based on what the school reports for your rate of pursuit or training time. For example, if your school reports 9 credit hours as full time for your graduate program, we’ll pay you the full-time rate if you’re taking 9 credit hours. Can I take courses at more than one school at a time? You can take courses at more than one school under the GI Bill if you meet these requirements: The school granting your degree considers the courses at the second school to be required in order to get your degree, and The school granting your degree authorizes the second school to certify the courses to us Can I use the GI Bill to pay for courses toward more than one degree? Yes. After earning your first degree, you can use any GI Bill benefits you have left over to pay for courses for another degree. You can also take courses for 2 separately approved degrees at the same school or within the same school system at the same time. This is called a dual degree program.

    "title": "Eligibility For Veteran Readiness And Employment | Veterans Affairs",
    "content": "In this section Eligibility for Veteran Readiness and Employment Learn about eligibility requirements for Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E)—formerly called Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment. If you’re a service member or Veteran and have a disability that was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service and that limits your ability to work or prevents you from working, you may be able to get employment support or services to help you live as independently as possible. If I’m a Veteran, am I eligible for Veteran Readiness and Employment? You’re eligible to apply for VR&E benefits and services if you meet both of these requirements: All of these must be true: You didn’t receive a dishonorable discharge, and You have a service-connected disability rating of at least 10% from VA When we receive your VR&E application, we’ll schedule your initial evaluation with a Vocational Rehabilitation Counselor (VRC). The VRC will determine if you’re entitled to receive VR&E benefits and services. If you were discharged from active duty before January 1, 2013, your basic period of eligibility ends 12 years from one of these dates, whichever comes later: The date you received notice of your date of separation from active duty, or The date you received your first VA service-connected disability rating The basic period of eligibility may be extended if a VRC finds that you have a serious employment handicap (SEH). Having an SEH means your service-connected disability significantly limits your ability to prepare for, obtain, and maintain suitable employment (a job that doesn’t make your disability worse; is stable; and matches your abilities, aptitudes, and interests). If you were discharged from active duty on or after January 1, 2013, the 12-year basic period of eligibility doesn’t apply to you. There’s no time limit on your eligibility. If I’m still on active duty, am I eligible for Veteran Readiness and Employment? You may be eligible for VR&E benefits and services if you’re a service member and you meet at least one of these requirements. At least one of these must be true: You have a 20% or higher pre-discharge disability rating (memorandum rating) and will soon leave the military, or You’re waiting to be discharged because of a severe illness or injury that occurred while you were on active duty Learn more about accessing VR&E services through the Integrated Disability Evaluation System Note: Severely injured active-duty service members can automatically receive VR&E benefits before VA issues a disability rating. This is according to Sec. 1631(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act (PL 110-181). Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD): If you have an illness or injury that you believe was caused—or made worse—by your active-duty service, you can file a claim for disability benefits through the BDD program 180 to 90 days before you leave active duty. This may help speed up the claim decision process so you can get your benefits sooner. Learn more about BDD and what to do if you have less than 90 days left on active duty Go to our video about BDD (YouTube) What should I do if I received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable discharge? If you’ve received one of these discharge statuses, you may not be eligible for VA benefits. There are 2 ways you can try to qualify: Apply for a discharge upgrade Ask for a VA Character of Discharge review Learn about applying for a discharge upgrade and requesting a Character of Discharge review How do I apply if I already have a VA disability rating? You can apply online right now. Apply for VR&E benefits Learn more about how to apply Note: You can apply if you’re a service member who hasn’t received a disability rating yet. What kind of VR&E services can I get? Depending on your needs and goals, services may include: A complete evaluation to determine your abilities, skills, and interests for employment Professional or vocational counseling and rehabilitation planning for employment services Employment services such as job training, resume development, and other work-readiness support Help finding and keeping a job, including the use of special employer incentives and job accommodations On-the-job training (OJT), apprenticeships, and non-paid work experiences Post-secondary education and training at a college, vocational, technical, or business school Compare VA education benefits Supportive rehabilitation services including case management, counseling, and medical referrals Independent living services to help you live as independently as possible If I’m eligible for GI Bill benefits, can I get paid the Post-9/11 GI Bill subsistence rate for my VR&E program? If you’re participating in a VR&E program, you can choose to get paid the GI Bill subsistence rate instead of the Chapter 31 subsistence allowance rate if you meet both of these requirements. Both of these must be true: You have at least 1 day of entitlement remaining under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and You’re within your GI Bill eligibility period Note: In most cases, the GI Bill rate is higher. You’ll need to officially choose the GI Bill subsistence rate. Your VRC can help you with this. Contact your VRC for more information Check the current Chapter 31 subsistence allowance rates Check the current Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit rates Will VA deduct my VR&E benefits from my VA education entitlement? If you use VR&E benefits, we won’t deduct entitlement from your other VA education benefits, like the Post-9/11 GI Bill or the Montgomery GI Bill. If you’ve used benefits under any other VA education program and then you use VR&E benefits, we’ll have to deduct from your remaining VR&E entitlement the amount of time used under the other VA education program. But if you already used other VA education benefits and we determine that you’re eligible for VR&E, we may retroactively approve your previous months of entitlement and return them to the other VA education program. This is called “retroactive induction.” Ask your VRC if you meet the eligibility criteria for a retroactive induction.

    "title": "VA Help To Avoid Foreclosure | Veterans Affairs",
    "content": "In this section VA help to avoid foreclosure If you fall behind on your mortgage payments, your mortgage servicer (the company that handles collecting the money for your lender) can take your house to cover the money owed. This process is called foreclosure. Find out how our VA loan technicians can help you avoid foreclosure and keep your house. Can I get VA counseling to help avoid foreclosure? If you’re a Veteran or the surviving spouse of a Veteran, we’ll provide counseling—even if your loan isn’t a VA-guaranteed loan. If you have a VA-guaranteed loan, you can contact us anytime to discuss your loan. If you have a VA-guaranteed loan and it’s 61 days past due, we’ll automatically assign a VA loan technician to review your loan. What should I do if I’m having trouble paying my mortgage? If you’re having trouble making your mortgage payments, contact your loan servicer right away. They will work with you to try to find a solution to your situation. If you’re nervous about contacting your servicer, or if you’d like our help and advice, please contact a VA loan technician at 877-827-3702 . You can also send us a message online through our home loan guaranty support portal. Go to our Loan Guaranty Support portal Be careful of potential scams If you’re behind on your mortgage payments, contact us or the servicer of your mortgage to get help. And be careful of scams. Work only with trusted organizations. How can I avoid foreclosure? There are 6 general ways you can try to avoid a foreclosure. Our VA loan technicians can help you figure out which option is best for you. Contact a VA loan technician at 877-827-3702 . These are your options for trying to avoid foreclosure: Repayment plan: If you’ve missed a few mortgage payments, this plan lets you go back to making your regular payments, with an added amount each month to cover the ones you’ve missed. Special forbearance: This plan gives you some extra time to repay the missed mortgage payments. Missed payments aren’t automatically added to the end of your loan. You must contact your servicer to discuss how you’ll make payments after the special forbearance ends. Loan modification: Sometimes you need a fresh start. This plan lets you add the missed mortgage payments and any related legal costs to your total loan balance. You and your servicer then come up with a new mortgage payment schedule. Note: Due to rising interest rates, the modified payment amount could increase. Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase program: Starting May 31, 2024, if you have a VA-guaranteed loan, you may be able to participate in the Veterans Affairs Servicing Purchase (VASP) program. Through VASP, VA buys the modified loan through your loan servicer. Your servicer must first have tried all other options to help you keep your home. Learn more about VASP Extra time to arrange a private sale: If you need to sell your home, this plan lets you delay a foreclosure so you have time to sell. Short sale: If you owe more money than your house is worth, your servicer might agree to a short sale. This means the servicer will accept the total proceeds from the home sale (even if it’s less than the full amount you owe on the mortgage) as full payment of the debt you owe. Note: This option could result in a loss or reduction in your future home loan benefit. Contact a VA loan technician at 877-827-3702 for more details. Deed in lieu of foreclosure: This plan lets you avoid the foreclosure process by signing over the deed to the home to your servicer. The home will then belong to the servicer. Note: This option could result in a loss or reduction in your future home loan benefit. Contact a VA loan technician at 877-827-3702 for more details. If I can’t avoid foreclosure, will I have to pay back my loan? If your loan closed before January 1, 1990, and we have to pay back the amount of your loan to the servicer, you may need to pay this amount back to the government. If you can’t repay a VA debt, you may be able to get a waiver. Learn more about waivers for VA debt If your loan closed on or after January 1, 1990, and we have to pay back the amount of your loan to the servicer, you’ll need to pay this amount back to the government if we find evidence of fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith on your part. How does foreclosure affect my future home loan benefit? If your loan ends in foreclosure, short sale, or deed in lieu of foreclosure, you’ll need to pay back the amount we lost on your loan to restore your future benefit. We call this process “restoration of entitlement.” To find out the amount you need to pay to restore your entitlement, contact a VA loan technician at 877-827-3702 .

This includes members of the United States Public Health Service Inactive Reserve Corps (IRC), or You’re within 1 year and 120 days of being put on the Temporary Disability Retirement List (TDRL), or You had part-time Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI) as a member of the National Guard or Reserve. And you suffered an injury or disability (damage to your body or mind that makes it hard for you to do everyday tasks, including meaningful work) while on duty—including direct traveling to and from duty—that disqualified you for standard premium insurance rates. Who’s covered? Veterans Former service members What life insurance benefits can I get with VGLI? You can get between $10,000 and $500,000 in term life insurance benefits. The amount you’ll get will be based on how much SGLI coverage you had when you left the military. Learn about the difference between VGLI term life insurance and whole life insurance coverage Note: When you leave the military, you can sign up through VGLI for coverage up to the amount you had through SGLI. If you have less than the maximum coverage, you can increase your coverage by $25,000 1 year after getting VGLI and then every 5 years after that. You can increase your coverage up to a total of $500,000 until you’re 60 years old. How do I get these benefits? You’ll need to apply for VGLI within 1 year and 120 days of leaving the military. If you sign up within 240 days of leaving the military, you won’t need to prove you’re in good health. If you sign up after the 240-day period, you’ll need to submit evidence that you’re in good health. Apply in 1 of these ways: Apply through the Office of Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (OSGLI), using the Prudential website. Apply online through OSGLI Apply by mail or fax.

    "content": "In this section Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI) Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance (VMLI) offers mortgage protection insurance to the families of Veterans with severe service-connected disabilities who’ve adapted a home to fit their needs. Find out if you qualify—and how to apply and manage your coverage. Am I eligible for Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance? You may be eligible for VMLI if you meet all of these requirements. All of these must be true: You have a severe disability that we’ve concluded was caused—or made worse—by your service, and You received a Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) grant to buy, build, or make changes (like installing ramps or widening doorways) to a home so you can live more independently, and You have the title of the home, and You have a mortgage on the home, and You’re under 70 years old Find out if you qualify for an SAH grant—and how to apply Who’s covered? Service members Veterans What kind of life insurance benefits can I get with VMLI? Up to $200,000 in mortgage life insurance—paid directly to the bank or other lender that holds your mortgage. Important details about VMLI: The money will be paid directly to the bank or other lender that holds your mortgage—not to a life insurance beneficiary (a person chosen to receive the money from a policy when the insured dies). The amount of coverage will equal the amount you still owe on your mortgage, but won’t be more than $200,000. VMLI is a decreasing-term insurance. This means your coverage amount goes down as your mortgage balance goes down. If you pay off your mortgage, your VMLI coverage will end. VMLI has no loan or cash value—and it doesn’t pay dividends (cash payments made to policy holders when the company makes a profit). How do I get these benefits? First, you’ll need to apply for an SAH grant. If you get the SAH grant, your loan guaranty agent will tell you if you qualify for VMLI. If you already have an SAH grant, ask your agent about VMLI. Your agent will help you fill out a Veterans’ Mortgage Life Insurance Statement (VA Form 29-8636). Get VA Form 29-8636 to download Note: Remember, you must apply for VMLI before your 70th birthday. How much will I pay for these benefits? Your VMLI premium will be based on all of these factors: Your age, and The current balance of your mortgage loan, and How many more mortgage payments you need to make to pay off your mortgage, and The amount of VMLI coverage you need Use our VMLI Premium Calculator to figure out what your premium may be. Go to the VMLI Premium Calculator What happens if I move, refinance, or make other changes to my mortgage? The home covered by VMLI must be your primary residence (the home where you live most of the time). To keep your VMLI coverage, you’ll need to let us know if you make any of these changes: Move, or Transfer your mortgage from one lender to another, or Liquidate your mortgage (such as giving up the home through foreclosure or bankruptcy liquidation because you can’t pay the mortgage), or Refinance your home (take out a new mortgage loan under different terms), or Sell your property Send notice of any changes to: Department of Veterans Affairs Regional Office and Insurance Center PO Box 7208 (VMLI) Philadelphia, PA 19101 What to know if you refinance your home If you refinance your home after getting VMLI, your VMLI premium may increase if any of these are true for you: You’re older, or You have a higher mortgage loan, or You have a longer mortgage loan term than you did before you refinanced your home, or You have more VMLI coverage Before you refinance, use our VMLI Premium Calculator to check what your new premium will be.

    "title": "Life Insurance Dividend Payment Options | Veterans Affairs",
    "content": "Life insurance dividend payment options Some life insurance policies pay dividends. These are extra funds returned to policyholders each year. If you have National Service Life Insurance or Veterans’ Reopened Insurance, your policy pays dividends. These policy numbers begin with the letters V, J, or JR. Keep reading to learn about your options for receiving or using your dividend. Option 1: Pay your annual policy premium If your dividend is less than your annual premium, you’ll receive a bill for the difference. If your dividend is more than your policy’s annual premium, you’ll have to decide what to do with the money that’s left. You can choose from these options: Request that we pay you in cash, or Buy paid-up additional insurance (option 2) , or Repay a policy loan or lien if you have one (option 4) Option 2: Buy paid-up additional insurance The insurance you buy with your dividends is in addition to your basic coverage, and you can buy it at any age. You’ll earn dividends on both your basic coverage and the paid-up additions. With paid-up additions, you can do the following: Get more protection for your beneficiaries, and Have cash and loan values, and Earn dividends, and Stop paying premiums Option 3: Deposit your dividend into a VA interest-earning account When you deposit your dividend into an interest-earning account at VA, the interest you earn isn’t taxable. You may withdraw money at any time by calling us at 800-669-8477 . You can also send us a written request.

    "content": "In this section Types of Veteran ID cards There are many types of identification cards you can use to show you’re a Veteran. You only need to have one of them for this purpose. Learn about the different types of VA ID cards and other Veteran ID options. Department of Defense Identification Card A Department of Defense (DoD) Identification Card is used to show your military status and to get access to services at military bases. You may also use this card to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. If you have a DoD Identification Card, you don’t need to request another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran or to get retail or business discounts. You may be eligible if one of these descriptions is true for you. One of these must describe you : You’re retired from the military, or You’re on active duty, or You’re in the National Guard, the Reserves, the Selected Reserves, or Inactive Ready Reserve Note: Depending on your status, the DoD issues either a Common Access Card (CAC) or a Uniformed Services ID Card (USID). For both types of DoD cards, you’ll need to either be a sponsor or have a sponsor. You’ll need to fill out an Application for Identification Card/DEERS Enrollment (DD Form 1172-2). Download DD Form 1172-2 (PDF) Then turn in your completed application to a Real-Time Automated Personnel Identification System (RAPIDS) office for processing. Learn more about how to apply for a DoD Identification Card Veteran Health Identification Card When you’re enrolled in VA health care, you get a Veteran Health Identification Card (VHIC) that you use to check in to your appointments at VA medical centers. You may also use this card to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. If you have a VHIC, you don’t need to request another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran or to get retail or business discounts. You need to be enrolled in VA health care to receive a VHIC. If you aren’t signed up for VA health care, you can apply online now. Find out how to apply for VA health care If you’re already enrolled in VA health care, you can request your VHIC online or in person at your nearest VA medical center. Learn how to get your VHIC Veteran ID Card A Veteran ID Card (VIC) is a digital photo ID you can use to get discounts for Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. When you have this card, you won’t need to carry around your military discharge papers or share sensitive personal information to get discounts. And you don’t need to request another type of photo ID card to prove you’re a Veteran or to get retail or business discounts. You may be eligible if you meet both of the requirements listed below. Both of these must be true : You served on active duty, in the Reserves, or in the National Guard (including the Coast Guard), and You received an honorable or general discharge (under honorable conditions) If you received an other than honorable, bad conduct, or dishonorable character of discharge, you’re not eligible for a Veteran ID Card. If you have an uncharacterized or unknown discharge status, we’ll have to verify your eligibility before we approve your application. You can apply online now. Learn more about how to apply for a Veteran ID Card Note: As of September 2022, all new Veteran ID Cards are digital. If you already have a physical Veteran ID Card, you can continue using it to get discounts. Veteran’s designation on a state-issued driver’s license or ID At this time, all 50 states and Puerto Rico offer a Veteran designation (an identifying mark) printed on state-issued driver’s licenses or IDs. The type of Veteran designation may vary from state to state.\n\nIf you have a Veteran’s designation, you may be able to get discounts offered to Veterans at many stores, businesses, and restaurants. Most states ask you to provide a copy of your discharge papers (DD214 or other separation documents). Some states may require additional documents. Please check with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles about what you need to apply for a Veteran’s designation for your state. Last updated: November 14, 2022 Feedback"

These adjustments help to make sure that the purchasing power of your benefits keeps up with inflation. Get the latest cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) information on the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) website How to use the tables to find your monthly payment Find your basic rate Go to the compensation rates for your disability rating. On the Basic monthly rates table, find the amount for your disability rating and dependent status. This is your basic monthly rate. Example (Veteran with no children): If you’re a Veteran with a 30% disability rating, and you have a dependent spouse (no dependent parents or children), your basic monthly rate would be $601.42 each month. Find your added amounts, if any apply If your spouse receives Aid and Attendance benefits or you have more than one child, you may qualify for additional monthly payment amounts as listed in the Added amounts table. Learn more about Aid and Attendance benefits First, determine your basic rate. Example (Veteran with children): If you’re a Veteran with a 70% disability rating, and you have a spouse, plus 3 dependent children under the age of 18, you would start with the basic rate of $2,018.19 (for a Veteran with a spouse and 1 child). Next, look at the Added amounts table. Find the amount for children under age 18 ($74.00). Since your basic rate already provides payment for 1 child, you would add the rate of $74.00 for each additional child (so $74 x 2). If your spouse receives Aid and Attendance, you would also add $137 (which is the added amount for a spouse receiving Aid and Attendance, for a Veteran with a 70% disability rating). In our example of a Veteran with 70% disability rating, your total monthly payment amount would be: $2,018.19 basic rate (1 spouse, 1 child) +$74 (second child under 18) +$74 (third child under 18) +$137 (spouse who receives Aid and Attendance) Total $2,303.19 Past rates Review Veterans disability compensation rates for past years. 2024 rates (effective December 1, 2023) 2023 rates (effective December 1, 2022) 2022 rates (effective December 1, 2021) 2021 rates (effective December 1, 2020) 2020 rates (effective December 1, 2019) 2019 rates (effective December 1, 2018) 2018 rates (effective December 1, 2017) Last updated: December 2, 2024 Feedback"
